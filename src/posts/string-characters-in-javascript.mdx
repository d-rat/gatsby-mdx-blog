# Characters in a string in JavaScript

## suppose my string contains:

    var mainStr = "str1,str2,str3,str4";

I want to find the count of comma `,` character, which is 3.
And the count of individual strings after the split along comma, which is 4.

You can find such as:

    console.log(("str1,str2,str3,str4".match(/,/g) || []).length);

or you can also find like this

    (mainStr.split(",").length - 1)

for finding any arbitrary sting str you can do like this:

    mainStr.split("str").length - 1)
